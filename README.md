I made a change to the nested 2024_competition repo to allow me to change the billboard. It was hard to explain in the commit message... anyways

# NEXT STAGE

- Extract plenty of examples
- Run them through the CNN I'm building on Colab
- (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P0j5OBePBGmmYEO2-LqW9yZ2Fc2BDcIC?usp=sharing)
- Add a new button for making a prediction in the GUI
- Add the letter slicing functionality that I already created in Colab into the robot
- Find out how to link the new make prediction button to parsing the letters currently on screen and publishing to the scoreboard
